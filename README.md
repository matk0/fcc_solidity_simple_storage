## MY FIRST SOLIDITY PROJECT :smile:
I decided to go through [Solidity, Blockchain, and Smart Contract Course â€“ Beginner to Expert Python Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M576WGiDBdQ). This is the first project in the course called __Simple Storage__.

- [x] creating new contracts
- [x] getting to know the datatypes
- [x] learned about mapping "datatype"
- [x] learned about the __factory pattern__
